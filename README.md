# SnapRobot

SnapRobot is a app runs on mobile phones.It works like an extension of visual programming language Snap!
It could work as a wireless connection to hardwares or a message dispatcher for diffrent coders who connects their Snap! program to it.
It also delivers the blocks which could access the sensors of the phone.
Your could program with Snap! in this app too which means you could use a Snap! program on the phone to controll another program on pc. 
More than two players could use their phones to controll diffrent sprites in one program on pc.
It supports remote events too.With these features we could play a Snap! game as we are using WII or we could teach children network protocols with remote events.
They are all interesting ways of learning coding.

Snap! for SnapRobot is based on [Snap<i>!</i> Build Your Own Blocks](http://snap.berkeley.edu) written by Jens Mönig and Brian Harvey.
